# Advanced Binary Search

Advanced binary search refers to variations of the traditional binary search algorithm that incorporate additional functionality or handle specific scenarios.

## 1. Binary Search with Equality Condition

The traditional binary search algorithm focuses on finding a specific target value. However, sometimes we need to search for a condition other than equality, such as finding the first element greater than or equal to a target value.

- Instead of stopping the search when the target value is found, modify the algorithm to continue searching until the desired condition is met.
- Adjust the update of `low` and `high` based on the condition being searched for.

## 2. Binary Search on Floating-Point Numbers

Binary search can be extended to work with floating-point numbers, although it requires special consideration due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic.

- Instead of comparing elements directly for equality, use a **tolerance level** to determine when two floating-point numbers are considered equal.
- Adjust the update of `low` and `high` based on the comparison of floating-point numbers.

## 3. Binary Search in Rotated Sorted Arrays

Binary search can be applied to find an element in a rotated sorted array, where the array has been rotated cyclically at some pivot point.

- Modify the algorithm to check **which half of the array is sorted** and adjust the search accordingly.
- Determine whether to search the **left or right half** based on the comparison of the target value with the elements at the bounds.

## 4. Binary Search with Duplicates

When dealing with an array that contains duplicate elements, the traditional binary search may not provide the correct index or find the desired element.

- Modify the algorithm to handle cases where there are **duplicates** in the array.
- Consider additional conditions, such as checking **neighboring elements** to ensure the correct index or finding the desired element.

## 5. Interpolation Search

Interpolation search is an advanced variation of binary search that performs better when the elements in the array are **uniformly distributed**.

- Instead of always choosing the middle element as the pivot, **interpolate** the position of the target element based on its value and the values of the first and last elements.
- Adjust the update of `low` and `high` based on the **interpolated position**.
